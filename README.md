# PyTorch-Implementations-of-TCLoss
🚀We could not know the reason why the code for TCLoss from ICCV2023 Paper *Dynamic Snake Convolution based on Topological Geometric Constraints for Tubular Structure Segmentation* has not been released yet.

🚀We'are trying to fix the TCLoss for our own work.

⌛️**Codes will be released soon, please wait patiently.**
