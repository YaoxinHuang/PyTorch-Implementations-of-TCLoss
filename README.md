# PyTorch-Implementations-of-TCLoss
We could not know the reason why the code for TCLoss from ICCV2023 Paper *Dynamic Snake Convolution based on Topological Geometric Constraints for Tubular Structure Segmentation* is not released yet.


We'are trying to fix the TCLoss for our own work.


**Codes will be released soon, please wait patiently.**
